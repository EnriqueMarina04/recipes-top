    <h1>Recipe Steps</h1>

        <br>
        <li>Start with a medium bowl that's been lightly coated with olive oil. 
            Add warm water (about 110 degrees F), dry yeast and sugar.
             Note: The activated yeast feeds on the sugar and makes the dough rise. 
             In another bowl, combine flour and salt. 
             Have a fork, cutting board, knife, pizza pan and rolling pin (optional) handy.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            In the bowl containing the flour and salt, make a well in the center and add the yeast.
            Tip: If the yeast doesn't foam, check the expiration date and water temperature (should be approximately 110 degrees F). 
            Add the olive oil. Use a fork to pull the dry into the wet, then mix.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            When the dough starts to come together, get in there with your hands and knead it for a few minutes 
            on a lightly floured board. Use the heel of your hand to push the dough down and forward. 
            Give it a few turns. You're done when the dough is a little tacky.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Sprinkle a pizza pan with a little semolina for good separation and a nutty crunch. 
            Place a ball of dough in the center of the pan and spread it out, using a rolling pin or your hands. 
            Spin it. Pull the dough to the edges of the pan to thin out the center. 
            Add some more semolina for better separation. Make sure the thickness is even.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Top the spread dough with your favorite ingredients and bake in a 500-degree F oven
            for approximately 10 minutes. Perfect pizza every time. Watch our how-to video for more.
