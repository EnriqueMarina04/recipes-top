    <h1><strong>Recipe steps</strong></h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Have all of your ingredients ready on your kitchen bench and close to your cooking area if possible.
             This recipe cooks FAST. You don't want to be head deep into your refrigerator searching 
             for your wine, for example, while the shrimp is cooking away on the stove. Over-cooked shrimp
              is rubbery, tough and not pleasant to eat at all.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            The shrimp is cooked in a butter/oil combination prevent the butter from burning. 
            You can use all butter if you wish, just note it will begin to brown while the shrimp are cooking. 
            (Nothing wrong with a little browned butter.) Though, I do prefer the flavour of a butter/oil mixture in this. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            I love extra large or jumbo shrimp (or prawns) in this recipe! They're fat and juicy and perfect for a shrimp scampi! 
            If you can find wild-caught shrimp, please cook with those. Better flavour, better colour and a lot healthier for 
            you than farm-raised seafood. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Use a good quality white wine. I use a Sav Blanc when cooking this recipe. You can also use a Pinot Grigio or Chardonnay. 
        </li>
        <br>
    </ol>
